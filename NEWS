This file describes user-visible changes to Synopsis.

Synopsis 0.9
============

Support for C99 parsing has been greatly enhanced.

Support for Python code cross-referencing has been added.

The processing of source-embedded documentation has been greatly
enhanced. As a result, Synopsis now supports multiple markup formats,
such as Javadoc, and ReStructuredText. The latter requires python-docutils
to be installed.

Synopsis no longer depends on an external omniidl tool, as its IDL
parser is now self-contained.

Solidified and optimized SXR server.

Much enhanced HTML formatter.

Etc.
