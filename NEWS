This file describes user-visible changes to Synopsis.

Synopsis 0.10
=============

Synopsis' Internal Representation has been largely refactored, to better
supper the new features:

* More information is captured, for example relationships between primary
class templates and their specializations / instantiations.

* The storage of source-code cross-references has been simplified and integrated
into the IR, leading to a much more intuitive and convenient user interface.

The Python parser has been largely rewritten, adding support
for parsing of dependent (imported) files.

The DocBook formatter has been rewritten. It now supports Javadoc and ReST
document markup.

The HTML formatter has been enhanced in many respects. Many bugs have been fixed.

The C and C++ parsers have been enhanced, and many bugs have been fixed.

Some new ASG processors have been added (MacroFilter, TypedefFolder, et al.)

Documentation has been enhanced.


Synopsis 0.9
============

Support for C99 parsing has been greatly enhanced.

Support for Python code cross-referencing has been added.

The processing of source-embedded documentation has been greatly
enhanced. As a result, Synopsis now supports multiple markup formats,
such as Javadoc, and ReStructuredText. The latter requires python-docutils
to be installed.

Synopsis no longer depends on an external omniidl tool, as its IDL
parser is now self-contained.

Solidified and optimized SXR server.

Much enhanced HTML formatter.

Etc.
