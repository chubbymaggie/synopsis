Installation guide
==================
 
Building
--------

* If the sources are checked out from cvs, run './autogen.sh' to generate
  the configure scripts. This step requires autoconf to be installed.

* Run 'python setup.py build' to compile everything.
  This will place all files that are going to be installed under build/
  This step requires GNU make to be installed. If the executable 'make'
  is not GNU make, you have to set the 'MAKE' environment variable to
  GNU make.

  If you do not want to install, but rather try synopsis out from within the
  source directory, you may consider 'python setup.py build_ext --inplace'
  as an alternative, which will only compile the C/C++ extensions and put
  them right into the source tree.

Building documentation
----------------------

* 'python setup.py build_doc' will compile printable and html versions of
  the Tutorial as well as the Manual, and put them under share/doc/Synopsis

* All four targets require xsltproc, and the printable Tutorial requires
  additionally fop (from http://xml.apache.org)

* If you only want to build the html versions, run 
  'python setup.py build_doc --html'

* If you only want the Tutorial, run 'python setup.py build_doc --tutorial'

* etc.

Installing
----------

* To install synopsis in <prefix>, run 'python setup.py install --prefix=<prefix>'
  The default prefix is '/usr/local'.

* If documentation was built before, it will be installed into 
  <prefix>/share/doc/Synopsis

Using Synopsis
--------------

* Remember to set the PYTHONPATH variable if necessary.

* Read the tutorial to learn how to get started using synopsis.
