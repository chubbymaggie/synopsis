Random Thoughts
--------------

FIXED:
~~~~~
o. Prague/Sys/Time.hh has operator overloads which are incorrectly parsed.
o. Add filename support to all parsers
o. Add indexes by filename. Eg: TopLeft window can switch between namespaces
   and directories.
o. Change namespace index to only show Scopes.


NYI:
~~~
o. Write different comment parsers

o. Write different ScopeSorters

. Add command line option for only showing public/protected.

o. Make the modules/files indices modular so that they can be omitted as
desired

o. Make the C++ parser accept -I directives and strip filenames according to
them

. Make the HTML formatter allow to set a level to separate directories into
multiple indexes for the top-left frame

. Make an index page with a-z and links to all types with those names

. Make an option for HTML to put exception specs (raises (blah,blah)) in a
div like comment summaries are, or linked to details.
