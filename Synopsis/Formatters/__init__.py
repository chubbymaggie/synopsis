"""Package for the various output formatters.

The formatters are generally modules in this package, except for HTML which is
too complex to fit nicely in one module. Output from synopsis is directed
either to a data file (.syn) or through one of these formatters to produce a
variety of output formats. Some of the modules in this package are just
utilities however, and not formatters themselves.
