  Ideally, the entire thing should be do-able as a post-pass over
  the generated tree; I'm thinking of doing a couple simple examples
  of this to function as extra documentation.  Some of the possible
  things I was considering:
    1) Call-graph generator
        a) Change to find all dead code.
 
    2) Included file analysis (was the include necessary, etc.)
    3) Struct-packing analysis (is there excessive packing waste
                                for struct component alignment)
