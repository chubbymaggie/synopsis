just some random thoughts:

* synopsis should be callable like gcc:
  either build the docs in one process
  or write down individual trees (using pickle) 
  and assemble the doc then from these files.
  Which strategy to choose depends mainly on
  the size of the project. If using individual
  files one could use make to select which file 
  to rebuild
