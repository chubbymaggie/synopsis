This directory contains experimental code that may or may not
be moved into the 'public' framework. As synopsis is in heavy
development, it is distributed with the source distribution
anyways, hoping that it may whet your appetit.

To be able to compile the code, you will have to adjust the
(local) build system to your platform. You will at least
have to call $(srcdir)/configure <options> where options
is at least:

--with-python=<python>          the name of the python executable.
--with-syn-cxx=<syn-cxx-prefix> the prefix to the Synopsis library.

Additionally, you may have to modify the Makefiles to adjust
the names of the various boost libraries being used (unfortunately
the naming isn't consistent across platforms).

The following subprojects are being worked on:

* bpl :  A set of python extension modules that reflect the low
         level C++ parser API to python using boost.python.

* wave : A new CPP parser (i.e. preprocessor) backend based on
         boost.wave.




Good luck !
