This is experimental code !

Use boost.python (http://boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
to provide a python API to the C/C++ parser.

This may or may not become an 'official' synopsis API at some
point. For now it is only meant to be a sandbox for prototyping.

To compile it, be sure to have boost version >= 1.32 installed.
You may have to adjust the Makefile.

Good luck !
