This tool is a rewrite of the Synopsis.Parsers.Cxx.link module used to
render source views for C++ code.

Identifiers and names are marked up if the corresponding symbol can
be looked up, but the generated link is a placeholder that has to be
replaced in a later link stage.

Then the modified buffer is written to a file as xhtml.
