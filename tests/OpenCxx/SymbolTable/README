This test suite covers clause 3 of the C++ ISO 14882 standard.

It is based on a test suite described in

"Testing C++ Compilers for ISO Language Conformance"
(Brian A. Malloy, Scott A. Linde, Edward B.Duffy, James F. Power),

which is available at http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~malloy/projects/ddj/
together with the original testing framework.
